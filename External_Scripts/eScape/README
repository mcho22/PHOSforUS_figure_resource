## QUICK README TO SET UP eSCAPE.

1) Need to set path to included perl module library for *pl files.
	Replace instances of '<SET PATH>';
2) Need to set path to eScape Library.
	Set $TVWIN_LIBPATH accordingly.


## TO RUN eScape
   eScape reads in directory of fasta files (*.fasta).

	   >eScape_predictor_REP.pl [FASTA DIR] [OUTPUT DIR]

   OUTPUT FILES: 
	1) *eScapev8_pred
	Prediction output contains 8 columns, one for each 
	thermodynamic descriptor for both the native and denatured ensemble
	(Native: dG, dHap, dHp, TdS; Denatured: dG, dHap, dHp, TdS).

	Rows are for each position in the sequence.

	2) *eScapev8_log
	Report when default tripeptide values are used when unrepresented 
	in the eScape library.

## Additional smoothing of eScape predictions can be useful for more
	domain aggregate analysis. Smoothed predictions can be obtained 
	using:

  	    >eScape_predictor_domain_REP.pl [FASTA DIR] [OUTPUT DIR]

   OUTPUT FILES:
	1) *.eScapev8_domainX_avgpred (X = sliding window size for averaging)
	    Same as eScape8_log except predictions has been averaged with 
		respective sliding window size:

	i.e. - 	*.eScapev8_domain1_avgpred = window size of 1
			(0 residues flanking central residue of interest.)
		*.eScapev8_domain11_avgpred = window size of 11
			(5 residues flanking central residue of interest.)

	2) *.eScapev8_domainX_sdpred (X = sliding window size for averaging)
            Corresponding standard deviation values for respective sliding
                window size

	
### Summarize averaged dG predictions for each sliding window size as calculated with eScape_predictor_domain_REP.pl

	   >eScape_Domain_Summary_dG.pl
	
		run in directory containing *.eScapev8_domain*_avgpred files.
