Figure 1
Horizontal and vertical protein sequence information reflected in the conformational and binding equilibria of kinase-substrate interaction

Figure 2
Horizontal information is more strongly  conserved than vertical information in intrinsically disordered regions of protein families.

Figure 3
Proline residue at the +1 site (+1 Pro) of serine phosphorylation sites (pS) defines a subclass of site (pS-P) dependent on horizontal information

Figure 4
Phosphorylation sites containing +1 Pro are energetically poised to respond to phosphorylation by extension, mediated by charge and PII propensity

Figure 5
Architecture, training performance, and comparative effectiveness of PHOSforUS predictor

Figure S1
Sequence logos of Threonine and Tyrosine phosphorylated or non-phosphorylated amino acid sequence neighborhoods

Figure S2
Dividing phosphorylation sites by presence or absence of +1 Proline reveals two distinct subclasses in Serine and Theronine phosphorylation sites

Figure S3
Changes in charge distributions before and after phosphorylation events

Figure S4
Phosphorylation sites containing +1 Proline are energetically poised to respond to phosphorylation by extension, mediated by charge and polyproline II propensity

Figure S5
Phosphorylation site subclasses defined with +1 Proline show higher end-to-end distances than other subclasses

Figure S6
Threonine phosphorylation has a stronger effect on end-to-end distance increase than do Serine / Tyrosine phosphorylations

Figure S7
Subclass-specific receiverâ€“operating characteristics (ROC) of PHOSforUS constituent predictors

Figure S8
Receiver-operating characteristics (ROC) curve (upper panel) and precision-recall curve (lower panel) of PHOSforUS predictor & its subpredictors along with PSWM-based prediction results

Figure S9
Comparative effectiveness of protein phosphorylation site prediction by PHOSforUS

Figure S10
Horizontal information is better conserved than vertical information in intrinsically disordered region
